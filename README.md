Can ENCRYPT OR DECRYPT OFFLINE any text easily using this code. We can run this as .exe For running this as .exe we need to compile this python script with 'nuitka' software. 
video to install 'nuitka' to compile : " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3Qrm1CtQ0 "

running this code in powershell using python3 {version - python3.10}

If we have to use this code in WITHOUT PYTHON , Then we have to compile the code using NUITKA software. (youtube video of installing nuitka is given above)
or if we have python then can compile it by using PYINSTALLER. 

PYINSTALLER COMPILER 
COMMAND to install PYINSTALLER :

   " pip install pyinstaller "
   
We provided base64.exe file above if you needed to run as executable

Below shown the screenshot of compiled code, base64.exe
